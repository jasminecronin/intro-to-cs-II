# Introduction to Computer Science for Computer Science Majors II
Coursework for my second introductory computer science class.

## Dream Labyrinth

Term project done as a group of 4. The entire project is not listed, only the classes that were entirely mine. Most of the work I did for this project was pixel art generation, which is listed in the Assets folder.

The project was a 2D style shooter inspired by Space Invaders. The player plays a university student dreaming of donuts and ice cream cones, which they eliminate with hearts. Eventually though, the dreams turns to a student's nightmare where they instead start battling exams and textbooks inside a classroom.
