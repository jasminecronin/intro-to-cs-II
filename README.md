# Introduction to Computer Science for Computer Science Majors II
Coursework for my second introductory computer science class.

## Dream Labyrinth

Term project done as a group of 4. The entire project is not listed, only the classes that were entirely mine. Most of the work I did for this project was pixel art generation, which is listed in the Assets folder.

The project was a 2D style shooter inspired by Space Invaders. The player plays a university student dreaming of donuts and ice cream cones, which they eliminate with hearts. Eventually though, the dreams turns to a student's nightmare where they instead start battling exams and textbooks inside a classroom.

The SpriteAnimation class is used to control the animation of a 2D sprite using a spritesheet. The Clock class is an enemy type that plays an animation of a clock moving the hour hand a full cycle. Once the animation completes, the clock freezes the movement of the player for a specified amount of time. Then the player unfreezes and the animation begins again.

## Exercises

These were done as a group. There were 8 assignments total in the term, and I completed and submitted 4 of them.
